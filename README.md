## Description
Given a functional express API, I can connect to the database using sequelize. I have written the config connection to connect with my username and password with command startsql. i have the schema.sql file to drop the database "ecommerce_db" if exists and then re create it. my 5 models built to fields and rules for the the model, and a index.js to build the associations between models. My routes folder holds the routes with all the direction used in the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE commands requested when the API runs through insomnia. I am able to seed my API with the seed files given and add, delete, update or retrieve any one of them.
